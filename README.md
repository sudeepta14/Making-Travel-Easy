# Travel-App-with-voice-and-routing
This is an iOS app where we can search for a list of places, and on clicking on one of the places we can get the shortest route from our location. I have also added directions using map for turn by turn navigation. 

Do you want to try this app?

Step 1: Select a category you want to search for?

Step 2: The map will automatically render points of interest near you.

Step 3: It will also start voicing map directions on every turn using AVFoundation framework.

Step 4: The green circular regions are geo-regions, when it will enter the geo region, the voice will relay information.
